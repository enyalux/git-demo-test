Amazing Grace (Folk Version)
==============================

1.
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind, but now I see

2.
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace, my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

3.
When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we've first begun

4.
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind, but now I see
